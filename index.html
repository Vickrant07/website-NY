                <h4>#New York Times</h4>
                <p>
                    The Times Square was originally called Longacre Square until 1904, when the paper moved there. Longacre square doesn't quite sound the same, does it? 
                </p>
                <h4>#Pizza History</h4>
                <p>
                    NYC has a reputation for pizza. But did you know it's home to the first pizzeria in the country? Lombardi's opened in 1895 and serves some of the best pizza in the city today.
                    "Over the past 50 years, the price of pizza slices and subway rides have remained roughly the same, leading to what economists call "The Pizza Principle." Strangely, when the price of one increases, the other does as well".

                </p>
                <h4>#Lots of Babies</h4>
                <p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                5,000 years ago, Native Americans came to the area that is now known as New York. Their descendants include Indian tribes such as the Mohawk, the Cayuga, the Oneida, and the Seneca. Dutch colonists established New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island in 1624. After the British took over the area in 1664, the area became known as New York. However, after the American Revolution in 1776, New York became a U.S. colony, then became a state in 1788. One year later, George Washington was sworn in as the United States’ first president in New York City, then the country’s capital. 
                Washington, D.C., became its new capital the following year, in 1790. On September 11, 2001, hijackers crashed planes into New York's World TradeCenter.

            <h2>What Makes it so special?</h2>
            <p>
                Despite its size, New York City feels more like a cluster of small towns once you live here. Each New York neighborhood has its own character. There is something for everyone in NYC's best neighbourhoods, from Harlem to the Lower East Side, Astoria to Flushing, Brooklyn Heights to Coney Island, and the Bronx's Little Italy to Staten Island's St. George.
                You can see stunning architectural treasures and more New York City attractions than you can count - from the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State Building.
